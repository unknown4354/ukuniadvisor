            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              UKuniadvisor was born from a simple belief: every deserving
              student should have access to world-class British education,
              regardless of their background or financial situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our founder's journey from India to the UK - earning a PGDBM from
              Cardiff University and an MSc in International Business from the
              University of Surrey - gave us firsthand insight into the
              challenges international students face.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we've helped over 500 students achieve their UK education
              dreams, maintaining a 95% success rate while keeping our services
              completely free.
